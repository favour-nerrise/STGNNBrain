        "In this notebook, we show how to load the brain activity (resting fMRI) data and train an example model. The data is composed of 72, ten-minute brain scans. The brain data has been parcellated to include 116 or 630 general brain regions. 40 of the scans are from the fasted person while 32 of the scans are from the caffeinated person. We expect to see changes in brain connectivity between these two states due to caffeine influencing arousal.  \n",

Then, we sum a mean and max pooling of all the nodes in one graph, and pass this output through a linear layer and softmax to get the probability of the graph belonging to the caffeinated or the non-caffeinated class.\n"
